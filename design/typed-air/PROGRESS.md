## Completed

- Created local branch `feat/typed-air-precompiles` from clean
  `origin/main` at `385efb9a`.
- Read and analyzed the felt-to-AIR design supplied by the user.
- Inspected Stark-V main and the later compiler/opcode development history.
- Reproduced the pre-revert Stark-V AIR compiler and prover tests.
- Mapped the proposal onto current production constraints, formal extraction,
  witness construction, Poseidon infrastructure, and component scheduler.
- Defined project charter, engineering canon, target architecture, IR,
  precompile model, soundness invariants, implementation phases, task graph,
  validation ladder, performance protocol, and initial ADRs.
- Completed F-001: the isolated `air/lang` module has an explicit logical
  schema version, is named in the test inventory, and is imported by no
  production path. The ReleaseFast RISC-V package suite passed.
- Completed F-002: distinct typed IDs, semantic integer/layout validation,
  owned stable names and sources, checked source spans, and allocation-failure
  cleanup all pass in the ReleaseFast package suite.
- Completed F-003: explicitly hashed structural expression keys, stable
  topological IDs, commutative add/multiply interning, typed operation
  rejection, primary source preservation, deterministic replay, and
  allocation-failure cleanup pass.
- Completed F-004: arena-owned constraints, hints, ordered effects, and
  function signatures pass allocation-failure cleanup and whole-program
  validation. The allocation-free structural validator verifies canonical
  ranges, topological references, interning indexes, hint-output identity,
  selector use, unique access ordinals, stable names, sources, and signatures.
  Each validator error class has a focused named negative test.
- Completed F-005: the versioned `STWAIRL\0` logical encoding writes explicit
  tags and fixed-width little-endian integers after validation. Two separately
  allocated programs remain byte-identical when name and source interning order
  is reversed; reversing semantic effect order changes the bytes. The empty
  encoding is pinned and serialization has allocation-failure coverage.
- Completed F-006: a typed registry covers all twelve production relation
  domains in transcript order. Schemas pin version, field specifications,
  roles, challenge convention, multiplicity, ordinal, padding, public-boundary,
  and coefficient-bound policies. Tests cross-check every production arity and
  reject unknown IDs, wrong roles, arities, types, and ordinals.
- Completed F-007: static calls own typed argument and output pools, preserve
  explicit inline-versus-relation-backed lowering intent, and can target only
  earlier complete functions. Two-phase declarations make dependency order
  canonical and prevent recursion through the public builder; the independent
  validator rejects missing callees, forward/self edges, malformed call
  outputs, arity drift, and type drift. Manifest format 2 records calls and
  lowering strategy. The full ReleaseFast package suite and allocation-failure
  call path pass; all 25 validator error classes have named negative tests.

## Immediate next actions

1. F-008 — register hint recipes and validate output bindings.
2. F-010 — derive a domain-separated semantic program digest.
3. F-009 — render stable source-attributed diagnostics.

No production behavior should change in these tasks.

## Decisions

Accepted:

- Zig-authored canonical typed IR.
- Compatibility before optimization.
- One-proof guest precompiles before independent recursive leaves.
- Acyclic function graph in IR v0.

Pending:

- guest invocation ABI;
- guest Poseidon relation schema/version;
- canonical physical-layout manifest format;
- generated witness activation policy;
- cross-proof relation summary;
- recursive verifier field/protocol.

## Risks under watch

| Risk | Current control |
| --- | --- |
| New abstraction drifts from production | Shadow import and exact compatibility lowering |
| Compiler shares wrong semantics with witness | Sail, mutation, formal, and independent runner evidence |
| Layout changes silently | Versioned deterministic manifests |
| Typed DSL becomes stringly or magical | Canon relation/effect rules and constructor validation |
| Poseidon pilot becomes a toy | Exact 445-column production component target |
| Precompile weakens base-RV32IM claim | Pending explicit guest ABI ADR |
| Parallelism hides total cost | Performance vector and critical-path telemetry |
| Recursion balances detached calls | IR v0 rejects recursive function graphs |

## Baseline metrics

To be recorded before M2 implementation:

- current all-family logical node/constraint/event counts;
- current per-family maximum final degree;
- current Poseidon2 main/interaction geometry;
- current package/proof test durations;
- current RISC-V structural workload reports;
- current CPU and Metal Poseidon component timing.

## Log

### 2026-08-04 — M0 dossier established

Created the feature branch and this development directory. The architecture
decision is to complete the existing generic/symbolic design through a
canonical typed IR, rather than starting with an external language. Existing
Poseidon call collection and heterogeneous component scheduling make the
precompile path an extension of working machinery.

No production code changed. No soundness claim changed.

The repository-wide pre-commit source-conformance check is already red at the
`385efb9a` main baseline for unrelated Metal and lookup file-size entries.
The dossier passes the staged whitespace check, Zig formatting portion of the
hook, and local Markdown-link validation. This baseline failure must be
resolved separately before the hook can return green; it is not folded into
the typed-AIR scope.

### 2026-08-04 — M1 implementation started

Activated F-001. The first code change is limited to an isolated
`air/lang` module and explicit RISC-V test-inventory wiring. Production AIR,
witness, runner, prover, transcript, and formal-export paths remain unchanged.

F-001 completed with
`zig build test --build-file src/frontends/riscv/build.zig
-Doptimize=ReleaseFast -j2`. The package test-count floor observed the new
test, and the command exited successfully.

F-002 completed with the same ReleaseFast package command. Its focused tests
also run `checkAllAllocationFailures` across name/source ownership and verify
that distinct semantic IDs remain distinct Zig types.

F-003 completed with the same ReleaseFast package command. Structural hashing
uses explicit semantic fields rather than rendered text or object bytes; the
tests rebuild the graph in a second arena and require identical node keys.

F-004 completed with the same ReleaseFast package command. Whole-program
records remain isolated from production code. The validator is allocation-free
and checks all stored semantics independently of constructor success; 22
one-error corruption tests prove every public validator error is reachable and
stable. Allocation-failure enumeration now crosses hint output construction,
constraints, ordered effects, and functions.

F-005 completed with the same ReleaseFast package command. ADR-0005 fixes the
pre-production logical encoding. The serializer validates before output,
resolves names and source paths by content, preserves semantic record order,
and ignores allocator and interning-table accidents. Determinism, semantic
order sensitivity, invalid-program fail-closed behavior, and allocation
rollback each have focused tests.

F-006 completed with the same ReleaseFast package command. The isolated
registry uses enum domains and typed schema IDs instead of string dispatch. A
test-only bridge compares its stable order and arity to the production relation
entry authority; no shipped lookup or transcript behavior changed.

F-007 completed with the same ReleaseFast package command. Calls carry a typed
callee, optional lexical caller, arguments, generated output identities, source
span, and explicit inline or relation-backed strategy. Functions are declared
in dependency-topological order through a two-phase builder, so recursive and
forward edges cannot be constructed; the allocation-free validator rechecks
the complete graph and every call-output identity against raw arena state.
Manifest format 2 and logical schema 1 serialize this semantic distinction.
All 25 validator error classes have focused named rejection tests.

## Update protocol

Every progress update changes:

- status date;
- current milestone and active task;
- dashboard state;
- completed evidence;
- next three actions;
- new risks or decisions; and
- one dated log entry.

At most one task is marked active. A task becomes done only when its acceptance
evidence is named.
